# ChatBot

This chatbot makes use of the client-server architecture, TCP Protocol. 
For the graphical user interface (GUI), Tkinter is used. 

When communicating between the server-side script and the client-side script, our chatbot uses the machine's local IP address[PC]. 
The server-side script will display " *client IPÂ address* has connected" whenever a client connects to the chat room, allowing chatbot to function.
